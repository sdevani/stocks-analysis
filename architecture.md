Steps for building a stock analyzer
1. Scrape data
2. Add data to database
3. Add metadata
4. Run through variations for how to buy/sell
5. Print Results

Run through variations for buying/selling:
* Input should be an array of stocks in order of days
* Return value should be data to analyze profitability

I'd want to run `node strategies/_____.js`
I need to import a strategyRunner
I may need to import helpers as well
